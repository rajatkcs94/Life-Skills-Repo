## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**Question 2:**
To use B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) for creating habits:
- M (Motivation): Desire to do the habit.
- A (Ability): How easy or hard it is to perform the habit.
- P (Prompt): The reminder to do the habit.

We can make habits easier by lowering the barrier (increasing Ability) and setting clear prompts rather than relying on a push or motivation.

**Question 3:**
Celebrating after completing a habit — or "Shining" — is important because it creates a positive emotion towards behavior.
This rewarding feeling pushes the brain, so you are likely to repeat that activity.

**Question 4:** 
The idea was the concept of "compound interest of self-improvement." Just as a plant grows consistently into a tree, small, consistent efforts each day can create massive change over time.
This makes the habit process feel more achievable and motivating.

**Question 7:**  
To make a habit harder:
- Removing distractions.
- Giving daily time to complete the task.
